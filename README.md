# Auction House (Front End)

### What is this?
This is a site where users can trade used or new textbooks. Users can submit a buy or sell order, and see other buy or sell orders.
Users can also see the average price of textbooks in the past to judge the market. 

#### Typical user checking out market activity of a certain book:

#### Messaging someone to buy their book:

#### Placing an order:

### What problem does this solve?
The used textbook market is often very shady and students are often ripped off since there isn't one place to see the actual market value. By using this site,
users can see the market value, and market demand of a particular textbook. Users can assure they are not ripped off, and can try to predict the optimal time to buy or sell.
